Component that is Requesting a resource/computation from another component, the completer, which completes this request.\nARM SoC: Single Word Transaction\nThe simplest form of transaction that we need an interconnect protocol to support is the movement of a single word from a requestor to a completer, that is, a single-word write transaction.\nTo Support Single Word Write Transaction we can simply add\nThe WR signal and the WRDATA are recieved on the same rising edge.\nTo Support Single Word Write Transaction we can simply add\nThe RD signal is received at rising edge 0 cycle 0, then the RDDATA on the next rising edge\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002163252.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002163252.png\" target=\"_self\">Assumption &amp; disadvantages This assumes the completer can read/execute the request every clock cycle (1) We’ve assumed until now that there is only is one location, that is, only one register, in the completer (2) Asynchronous Reads\nnothing prevents an interconnect protocol from permitting read data to be returned during cycle C (and, in fact, many protocols do allow this); however, this would imply that the overall read operation is asynchronous and we have stated that the interconnect we are building is synchronous.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002164032.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002164032.png\" target=\"_self\">A Major Disadvantage with the current interconnect that its support for back-to-back rapid transaction is lack-luster and leaves clock cycles to be optimized.\nIn the general case of a completer with an N-cycle end-to-end read latency, the maximum data throughput will be: To Mitigate this we can add a LENGTH Control Signal to signal to the completer how much data is given to it to write/read.<br><img

(1)</a> is not true as the completer may need to process the request for many clock cycles.Terminiology\nThe mechanism through which a completer communicates its unavailability to a requestor is referred to as backpressure and a requestor waiting on a completer’s acknowledgement in this context is said to be stalled\nTo realize this feature, all we need is to implement a READY signal.\nA transaction starts only when WR/RD and READY are both asserted in the same clock cycle.\nAvoid Infinite Requestor Stalling\nif a requestor wants to start a transaction, then it should assert its control signals and keep them asserted until the completer’s READY signal is asserted, Two Design Decesions are employed here: the requestor must not check the READY signal before deciding to assert its control signals because otherwise the completer may never know of the requestor’s intention to start a transaction\ntransactions cannot be interrupted once started because a requestor cannot deassert its control signals early, and all data words must be transmitted for both entities to acknowledge the transaction has finished. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002190522.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002190522.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNotice That the Completer Asserts/Deasserts the READY signal for each data write B C &amp; D.\nReading from completors may also incur many clock cycles, There needs to be a control signal that registers that the data within the RDDATA bus is valid.For a read transaction, the RD signal does not convey the validity of the RDDATA bus, but rather the validity of the control signals relevant to starting a transaction (ADDR, LENGTH). We need an additional completer-to-requestor signal to convey the validity of the RDDATA bus.\nSo RDDATAVALID is born: once completer fetches data, the RDDATAVALID, is asserted.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002192210.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002192210.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Why would a Requestor Exert Backpressure on Completers? after all, shouldn’t a requestor know what it wants to write to the completer before initiating a burst transaction? This is the case when only a small amount of data needs transmitting, but if large amounts of data are involved some requestors may not know the extent of the payload they want to transmit at the outset. A common example would be a requestor reading from a FIFO.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003182710.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003182710.png\" target=\"_self\">\nTo Implement Requestor to Completer Backpressure, you can do this by deasserting the WR signal then asserting it again.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003183017.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003183017.png\" target=\"_self\">We cannot Approach it as Write Transaction\nAsserting RD when all of the data words from the previous transaction have not yet been received would be equivalent to the requestor telling the completer it wanted to start a new transaction as soon as the current one had terminated\nSome protocols allow requestors to signal for completers future transactions, this done by giving the Completer a notice so that it can ensure its internal buffers accommodate the burst transaction.We are not those protocols so we will add a new signal RDDATAREADY which when deasserted by the requester, the requester can stall the completer, and the completer will assert\\hold the current data in RDDATA bus until RDDATAREADY is asserted again.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003184041.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003184041.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Next on how to connect multiple requestors &amp;

As you increase the number of requestors, things get problematic as you would need a complete bipartite graph topology between requestors and completers, this does not scale well.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003185851.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003185851.png\" target=\"_self\">Thus we need something to Multiplex requestor signals to the needed completer. To do this we need to introduce an interconnect Fabric.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003190142.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003190142.png\" target=\"_self\">This is an elegant solution that simply lets requestor address the completers using an ADDR signal to the interconnect fabric. This is called the address space. All interconnects contain an address decoder which takes care of address resolution, this is just a bunch of comparators.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003190823.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003190823.png\" target=\"_self\">This arrangement of address decoder is very bulky, and introduces a long critical path reducing the interconnects maximum clock frequency. We can implement better address mapping to simplify the logic of address decoders.Lets propose only putting completers's address space on power of 2 addresses.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003191255.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003191255.png\" target=\"_self\">This way, we can simplify our logic, and instead of using comparators for both the upper bound and lower bound of the address space, we can just compare the most significant bit eliminating the need for a comparator and a subtractor:<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003191451.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003191451.png\" target=\"_self\">When dealing with multiple requestors it is not uncommon to have two requestors request a signal from a completer at the same time. Therefore there must be an intermediary entity, an arbiter that takes into account requestor requests.Shared bus architectures are viable when all completers and requestors share the same interconnect protocol interfaces. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004114249.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004114249.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAll requestor and completer interconnect interfaces have to be guarded by a tri-state gate because only a single requestor–completer pair can be connected to the bus at any given time.\nImplementation Note\nwe need instead to use an additional out-of-protocol signal between the requestors and the arbiter for this purpose (thus, shared buses use requestor-side arbitration).\nThe arbiter receives all requestor requests and sequentially grants bus access by enabling the specific requestor and completer’s tri-state gates.\nAdvantages Easy to Implement\nCan operate at high clock speed\nEconomical in Hardware resources Disadvantages\nDoes not Support any notion of concurrency, i.e, requestors cannot communicate with different completers in parallel.\nQuote\nShared-bus architectures can therefore cause requestors in a systems to spend a significant amount of time waiting for access to the bus, and waiting times get worse the more requestors exist in the system, which is an unfavorable situation for SoCs, which often contain many independent accelerator units that act as requestors. Shared-bus architectures are, therefore, rarely used in SoCs. Full Crossbar-Switch Architectures are Completer-side arbitration and this allows for maximum concurrency in the system.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004115810.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004115810.png\" target=\"_self\">\nOn the left Completers Switches 2-SW are closed as there is no requestor collision, On the right Completer's Switch is now open as there is requestor collision. Implementation Note \"full crossbar switches do not require any extra out-of-protocol signals for arbitration purposes because each switch can see when multiple transactions are simultaneously directed at the same completer and can automatically provide backpressure on all requestors except the one that was granted access to the completer. Therefore, the interconnect protocol itself acts as the arbitration mechanism\"\nThe Crossbar logic itself defines the arbitration policy: this can be round-robin priority of requestors, or priority access, basically a scheduler.\ndisadvantages\nFull Cross-bar switches require a lot of resources area-wise on the die. The area of the cross-bar switch grows quadratically with the number of requestors and completers in the system. (as it is basically a square matrix of sitches)\nQuote\nIn real-world SoCs, some requestors may only ever need connectivity to a subset of the system’s available completers. For example, while a CPU may need to be connected to most peripherals, a DMA unit may only need interconnection with memories. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004123946.png\"

Peripheral Bus) APB completers are often used together in a system to allow high-performance subsystems to communicate through AHB-Lite, while low-power subsystems interface with their higher-power

pipelined fashion. Thus, each operation consists of two phases:\nan address phase,\na data phase.\nTo support even higher bandwidth, AHB-lite utilizes wide data buses.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004135016.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004135016.png\" target=\"_self\">Some High-Level Observations supports power-of-two bus sizes that range from 8 to 1024 bits.\nThere are extra signals on the Subordinate side, HREADY and HSEL, that is because multiple subordinates can be connected to the same manager and the AHB-Lite protocol designers decided to expose the extra signaling to handle this multiplicity on the subordinate side of the interconnect. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004153340.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004153340.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNotice that the HREADY signals from subordinate side are many while it is only one on the manager side, that is because if one completer is still carrying out a request on the bus it needs to finish before the next request is issued, this ensures requests are carried out in order in the pipelined nature of this implementation.\n<br>The address decoder is combinational, that means it is stateless yet the multiplexer must be stateful, the multiplexer must be stateful to avoid the infinite stalling problem outlined in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect > ^e99960\" data-href=\"00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect#^e99960\" href=\"root/digital-design/interconnect/00-basic-1-to-1-interconnect.html#^e99960\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect</a>\nHSELx is outputted from address decoder, it selects the correct subordinate based on the address requested from the manager.\n<br>In contrast to the implementation in <a data-href=\"00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect\" href=\"root/digital-design/interconnect/00-basic-1-to-1-interconnect.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect</a>, we do not have a RD signal to subordinates, that is because we can use the off signal of HWRITE to signify read operations.\nDue to the binary nature of the HWRITE signal, we cannot put bus in idle Assume these set of Write operations <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004162523.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004162523.png\" target=\"_self\"><br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004163118.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004163118.png\" target=\"_self\">HTRANS is a 2-bit signal sent from the manager to the subordinate to indicate the type of transfer being requested.

This definition implies that HSIZE must remain constant throughout the burst and that the manager cannot change the data width between beats.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004174720.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004174720.png\" target=\"_self\">\nDuring a data phase, subordinates can deassert HREADY to insert wait states if they require more time to respond to a transfer, with the address phase of the next transfer only accepted when HREADY is high again.\nDue to the pipelined nature of AHB-Lite, Address phase cannot be stalled\nHowever, does it make sense for the manager to stall a single word transaction, it should support the word widths that it requests, otherwise it would use SEQ state.\nAlso, does it make sense for the manager to stall an IDLE state, it would just stall itself this way.\nSo AHB-Lite only supports stalling for burst transactions were the manager runs out of memory in internal buffers.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004195232.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004195232.png\" target=\"_self\"><br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251004201722.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251004201722.png\" target=\"_self\">The D and A components are the address decoder and the arbiter (a mux possibly?)What would happen if M1 and M2 try to access the Same resource, say S1?HMASTLOCKHRESPHPROT","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#csce/digital_design/hardware/interconnect"],"headers":[{"heading":"AHB-Lite &amp;

The most benefit is the model structure can seem directly from the codes.\nIt also makes the model conversion from other layer-based libs (Keras, TensorLayer, Caffe) to NNoM model very straight forward. When use&nbsp;generate_model(model, x_test, name='weights.h')&nbsp;to generate NNoM model, it simply read the configuration out and rewrite it to C codes.<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003212955.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003212955.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNNoM uses a compiler to manage the layer structure and other resources. After compiling, all layers inside the model will be put into a shortcut list per the running order. Besides that, arguments will be filled in and the memory will be allocated to each layer (Memory are reused in between layers). Therefore, no memory allocation performed in the runtime, performance is the same as running backend function directly.\nThe NNoM is more on managing the higher-level structure, context argument and memory. The actual arithmetics are done by the backend functions.\n<br>Currently, NNoM supports a pure C backend and CMSIS-NN backend. The CMSIS-NN is a highly optimized low-level NN core for ARM-Cortex-M microcontroller.

The most obvious feature is the human understandable interface.\nIt is also a layer-based framework, instead of operator-based. A layer might contain a few operators.\nIt natively supports complex model structure. High-efficiency network always benefited from complex structure.\nIt provides layer-to-layer analysis to help developer optimize their models. Notes: NNoM now supports both HWC and CHW formats.

The model will be quantised through model conversion&nbsp;generate_model(model, x_test, name='weights.h').The input data (activations) will need to be quantised then feed to the model.Performances vary from chip to chip. Efficiencies are more constant.We can use&nbsp;Multiply–accumulate operation (MAC) per Hz (MACops/Hz)&nbsp;to evaluate the efficiency. It simply means how many MAC can be done in one cycle.Currently, NNoM only count MAC operations on Convolution layers and Dense layers since other layers (pooling, padding) are much lesser.The script currently does not support implicit act:x = Dense(32, activation=\"relu\")(x)\nUse the explicit activation instead.x = Dense(32)(x)\nx = Relu()(x)\nEvaluation is equally important to building the model.<br>In NNoM, we provide a few different methods to evaluate the model.
