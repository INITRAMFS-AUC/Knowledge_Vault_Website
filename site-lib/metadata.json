a resource/computation from another component, the completer, which completes this request.\nARM SoC: Single Word Transaction\nThe simplest form of transaction that we need an interconnect protocol to support is the movement of a single word from a requestor to a completer, that is, a single-word write transaction.\nTo Support Single Word Write Transaction we can simply add\nThe WR signal and the WRDATA are recieved on the same rising edge.\nTo Support Single Word Write Transaction we can simply add\nThe RD signal is received at rising edge 0 cycle 0, then the RDDATA on the next rising edge\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002163252.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002163252.png\" target=\"_self\">Assumption &amp; disadvantages This assumes the completer can read/execute the request every clock cycle (1) We’ve assumed until now that there is only is one location, that is, only one register, in the completer (2) Asynchronous Reads\nnothing prevents an interconnect protocol from permitting read data to be returned during cycle C (and, in fact, many protocols do allow this); however, this would imply that the overall read operation is asynchronous and we have stated that the interconnect we are building is synchronous.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002164032.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002164032.png\" target=\"_self\">A Major Disadvantage with the current interconnect that its support for back-to-back rapid transaction is lack-luster and leaves clock cycles to be optimized.\nIn the general case of a completer with an N-cycle end-to-end read latency, the maximum data throughput will be: To Mitigate this we can add a LENGTH Control Signal to signal to the completer how much data is given to it to write/read.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image

(1)</a> is not true as the completer may need to process the request for many clock cycles.Terminiology\nThe mechanism through which a completer communicates its unavailability to a requestor is referred to as backpressure and a requestor waiting on a completer’s acknowledgement in this context is said to be stalled\nTo realize this feature, all we need is to implement a READY signal.\nA transaction starts only when WR/RD and READY are both asserted in the same clock cycle.\nAvoid Infinite Requestor Stalling\nif a requestor wants to start a transaction, then it should assert its control signals and keep them asserted until the completer’s READY signal is asserted, Two Design Decesions are employed here: the requestor must not check the READY signal before deciding to assert its control signals because otherwise the completer may never know of the requestor’s intention to start a transaction\ntransactions cannot be interrupted once started because a requestor cannot deassert its control signals early, and all data words must be transmitted for both entities to acknowledge the transaction has finished. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002190522.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002190522.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNotice That the Completer Asserts/Deasserts the READY signal for each data write B C &amp; D.\nReading from completors may also incur many clock cycles, There needs to be a control signal that registers that the data within the RDDATA bus is valid.For a read transaction, the RD signal does not convey the validity of the RDDATA bus, but rather the validity of the control signals relevant to starting a transaction (ADDR, LENGTH). We need an additional completer-to-requestor signal to convey the validity of the RDDATA bus.\nSo RDDATAVALID is born: once completer fetches data, the RDDATAVALID, is asserted.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251002192210.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251002192210.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Why would a Requestor Exert Backpressure on Completers? after all, shouldn’t a requestor know what it wants to write to the completer before initiating a burst transaction? This is the case when only a small amount of data needs transmitting, but if large amounts of data are involved some requestors may not know the extent of the payload they want to transmit at the outset. A common example would be a requestor reading from a FIFO.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003182710.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003182710.png\" target=\"_self\">\nTo Implement Requestor to Completer Backpressure, you can do this by deasserting the WR signal then asserting it again.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003183017.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003183017.png\" target=\"_self\">We cannot Approach it as Write Transaction\nAsserting RD when all of the data words from the previous transaction have not yet been received would be equivalent to the requestor telling the completer it wanted to start a new transaction as soon as the current one had terminated\nSome protocols allow requestors to signal for completers future transactions, this done by giving the Completer a notice so that it can ensure its internal buffers accommodate the burst transaction.We are not those protocols so we will add a new signal RDDATAREADY which when deasserted by the requester, the requester can stall itself, and the completer will not assert new data in RDDATA bus unless RDDATAREADY is asserted again.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003184041.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003184041.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Next <a data-href=\"01 Interconnect Fabric\" href=\"root/digital-design/interconnect/01-interconnect-fabric.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01 Interconnect Fabric</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#csce/digital_design/hardware/interconnect"],"headers":[{"heading":"Synchronous Interconnect Protocol Devving","level":1,"id":"Synchronous_Interconnect_Protocol_Devving_0"},{"heading":"Single Word Transactions","level":2,"id":"Single_Word_Transactions_0"},{"heading":"Writing","level":3,"id":"Writing_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":4,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Reading","level":3,"id":"Reading_0"},{"heading":"Notes","level":4,"id":"Notes_1"},{"heading":"Important notes","level":3,"id":"Important_notes_0"},{"heading":"Mitigating Drawback (2)","level":3,"id":"Mitigating_Drawback_(2)_0"},{"heading":"Waveform","level":4,"id":"Waveform_0"},{"heading":"Burst Transactions","level":2,"id":"Burst_Transactions_0"},{"heading":"Read Waveform","level":3,"id":"Read_Waveform_0"},{"heading":"Write Waveform","level":3,"id":"Write_Waveform_0"},{"heading":"Backpressure","level":2,"id":"Backpressure_0"},{"heading":"Completer Requestor Backpressure","level":3,"id":"Completer_Requestor_Backpressure_0"},{"heading":"Write Transaction w/ Backpressure","level":4,"id":"Write_Transaction_w/_Backpressure_0"},{"heading":"Waveform","level":5,"id":"Waveform_1"},{"heading":"Read Transaction w/ Backpressure","level":4,"id":"Read_Transaction_w/_Backpressure_0"},{"heading":"Waveform","level":5,"id":"Waveform_2"},{"heading":"Requestor Completer Backpressure","level":3,"id":"Requestor_Completer_Backpressure_0"},{"heading":"Write Transaction","level":4,"id":"Write_Transaction_0"},{"heading":"Read Transaction","level":4,"id":"Read_Transaction_0"}],"links":["root/digital-design/interconnect/01-interconnect-fabric.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"root/digital-design/interconnect/00-basic-1-to-1-interconnect.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20251002163252.html","images/pasted-image-20251002164032.html","images/pasted-image-20251002164741.html","images/pasted-image-20251002164822.html","images/pasted-image-20251002190522.html","images/pasted-image-20251002192210.html","images/pasted-image-20251003182710.html","images/pasted-image-20251003183017.html","images/pasted-image-20251003184041.html"],"createdTime":1759498031330,"modifiedTime":1759507379666,"sourceSize":10662,"sourcePath":"Root/Digital Design/Interconnect/00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect.md","exportPath":"root/digital-design/interconnect/00-basic-1-to-1-interconnect.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":22,"backlinks":["root/digital-design/interconnect/00-basic-1-to-1-interconnect.html","root/digital-design/interconnect/01-interconnect-fabric.html"],"type":"markdown"},"root/digital-design/interconnect/01-interconnect-fabric.html":{"title":"01 Interconnect Fabric","icon":"","description":"The Interconnect Built in <a data-href=\"00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect\" href=\"root/digital-design/interconnect/00-basic-1-to-1-interconnect.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">00 Basic 1 to 1 Interconnect</a> only accommodates 1 Requestor and completer.Interconnect Protocol Vs Interconnect Fabric\nThe interconnect protocol affects the types of transactions that can occur between a given requestor–completer pair, whereas the interconnect fabric’s implementation affects the communication patterns that can occur among different requestor–completer pairs.\nThe naive method would be making many Requestor interfaces for each completer but that would incur a lot of logic and chip area. As you increase the number of requestors, things get problematic as you would need a complete bipartite graph topology between requestors and completers, this does not scale well.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003185851.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003185851.png\" target=\"_self\">Thus we need something to Multiplex requestor signals to the needed completer. To do this we need to introduce an interconnect Fabric.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003190142.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003190142.png\" target=\"_self\">This is an elegant solution that simply lets requestor address the completers using an ADDR signal to the interconnect fabric. This is called the address space. All interconnects contain an address decoder which takes care of address resolution, this is just a bunch of comparators.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003190823.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003190823.png\" target=\"_self\">This arrangement of address decoder is very bulky, and introduces a long critical path reducing the interconnects maximum clock frequency. We can implement better address mapping to simplify the logic of address decoders.Lets propose only putting completers's address space on power of 2 addresses.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003191255.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20251003191255.png\" target=\"_self\">This way, we can simplify our logic, and instead of using comparators for both the upper bound and lower bound of the address space, we can just compare the most significant bit eliminating the need for a comparator and a subtractor:<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251003191451.png\"
